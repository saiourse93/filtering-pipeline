# IMSA on Nextflow
The **IMSA on Nextflow** is a modified version of the [Intergrated Metagenomic Sequence Analysis (IMSA)](https://sourceforge.net/projects/arron-imsa/) metagenomics pipeline developed by [Aaron Lab](http://dermatology.ucsf.edu/arronlab/Arron_Lab.html). The IMSA pipeline takes as input reads from high throughput sequencing and filters out exogeneous sequences in a host-genomic background. Assembly pipeline for exogenous reads filtered from human RNA-seq data.

# Dependencies
The pipeline depends on the following:
## Programs
1. Modified ```IMSA pipeline``` scripts (available on this repository)
2. Python
2. Bowtie
3. BLAT
4. NCBI-BLAST+
5. Trinity

## Databases and Reference Sequences

# Docker Image


# Configuration

# Pipeline Execution
