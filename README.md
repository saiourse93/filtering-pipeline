The **IMSA on Nextflow** is a modified version of the [Intergrated Metagenomic Sequence Analysis (IMSA) pipeline](https://sourceforge.net/projects/arron-imsa/) which takes as input reads from high throughput sequencing and filters out exogeneous sequences in a host-genomic background. Assembly pipeline for exogenous reads filtered from human RNA-seq data.
